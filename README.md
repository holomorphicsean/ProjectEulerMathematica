# ProjectEulerMathematica

This repository contains all of the Mathematica solutions I wrote for ProjectEuler. I try my best to avoid For or While loops when I can and use Mathematica's function-based syntax. The result is that, at times, the solution looks like an absolute mess, but I get it working pretty nicely.

Every solution code is appended by the following:

"Answer is " ~~ ToString[sol[[2]]] ~~ "\nExecution time: " ~~ ToString[sol[[1]]] ~~ " seconds"
 
And this gives the output a nice format, along with its execution time.
